This is basicly a clone of MediaWiki but it works a bit more how I like.

Its a Laravel app so to install, clone the repo and run `composer install` then 
clone the `.env.example` file and set it up with your own config.

You can use the command 

```php artisan app:create-user```

to interactively create a new user.
